    '<p style="text-align: left;">Fraser Gallop winemakersâ€™ goal is to capture and express the best of the estate and nuances of the property as a whole.</p>\n<p>Sourced solely from our vineyard and hand-crafted with minimal intervention in our estate winery, Fraser Gallop wines are a true expression of the here and now, altering only due to the vagaries of working with nature.</p>\n<p>The Fraser Gallop Estate suite of wines comprises Estate, Parterre and Palladian ranges available in both 750ml and large formats.</p>\n',
  short_description:
    '<p>This beautifully created and presented cabernet merlot blend is the product of outstanding vintage and clever understated winemaker. It has been left to the fruit do the talking. It&#8217;s firm and controlled, with grainy tannins cutting through the leafy blackcurrant cabernet. A little flash from merlot adds further plushness to the middle palate.</p>\n',
